Purpose
- Track the refactor workflow for OJO and keep progress synchronized in REFACTORING_PROPOSAL.md.

Workflow
- Use REFACTORING_PROPOSAL.md as the primary plan.
- After each completed milestone, update the progress section in REFACTORING_PROPOSAL.md.
- Keep changes compatible with existing frontend API paths.

Notes
- Security-sensitive changes must avoid logging secrets.
- Packaging must include src, config, script, docs, requirements, and test at ZIP root.
